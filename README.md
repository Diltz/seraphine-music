# What is it
This is my discord music bot that I wrote for my private community server.
Currently it supports next commands:
/play [search] (search can be text, url, playlist) (YouTube only)
/queue (Returns current queue)
/skip (Skip current track)

# Requirements
NodeJS (v18+)
FFmpeg installed (i don't recommend using npm ffmpeg, cuz it's bad)

# Language
I haven't translated messages, so it replies on russian language, you have to manually edit all ts scripts to set your preferred language
