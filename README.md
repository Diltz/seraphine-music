# What is it
This is my discord music bot that I wrote for my private community server.
Currently it supports next commands:

<b>/play [search]</b> <i>(search can be text, url, playlist)</i> <b>(YouTube only)</b><br>
<b>/queue</b> <i>(Returns current queue)<br></i>
<b>/skip</b> <i>(Skip current track)<br></i>

# Requirements
NodeJS (v18+)
FFmpeg installed (i don't recommend using npm ffmpeg, cuz it's bad)

# Language
I haven't translated messages, so it replies on russian language, you have to manually edit all ts scripts to set your preferred language
